# Auto-Correct

A reddit bot that looks through reddit comments for subreddit mentions. Runs subreddit through auto-correct algorithm and determines if a subreddit was misspelled and replies with the top matching subreddit.

to-do:
- integrate list of 1000 + popular subs that have a higher chance of being corrected too. Not too high but enough.
  For example, the below comment should prioritise /r/askreddit over /r/askredfit because it's much more popular.
  
  Oops... It looks like you missspelled "/r/asjredfit".

   I am **96.67%** sure that you meant **/r/askredfit**.
