# Subreddit-Auto-Correct-Bot

A reddit bot that looks through reddit comments for subreddit mentions. It runs non-existent subreddits through an (ameteur) auto-correct algorithm and determines if a subreddit was misspelled and replies with the top matching subreddit if it's above a certain threshold.

If you're wondering, i included a lot of the text files and random sorting/test scripts because im working on this bot from two different computers.

Using Python 3.5.2 and Praw 5.0.1
