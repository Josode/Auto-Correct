# Auto-Correct

A reddit bot that looks through reddit comments for subreddit mentions. Runs subreddit through auto-correct algorithm and determines if a subreddit was misspelled and replies with the top matching subreddit if it's above a certain threshold.

Using Python 3.5.2 and Praw 5.0.1

Extra random scripts not needed to run the bot are included because I'm working on this from two different computers.
